in this file.\n\n## v3.2.1 - 2025-10-16\n- 🚀 Enhancements\n - Improved Middleware Architecture\n - Refactored Express middleware to use a lazy require loader instead of top-level await.\n - Removed dependency on dynamic import('express'), improving compatibility with both CJS and ESM users.\n - Middleware can now be initialized synchronously, allowing:\n        \n    ```ts\n    import { Maskify } from 'maskify-ts';\n    app.use(Maskify.middlewares.express({ fields: ['email', 'phone'] }));\n\n    // or\n    Maskify.use(app, {\n        fields: ['email', 'phone'],\n        maskOptions: { autoDetect: true }\n    });\n    ```\n - Field Configuration Update\n    - Added support for per-field mask options in Express middleware: \n    ```ts\n        fields: [\n        { name: 'email', options: { type: 'email' } },\n        { name: 'card', options: { type: 'card', maxAsterisks: 6 } },\n        'phone'\n        ];\n    ```\n   - The middleware now merges field-specific and global maskOptions safely.\n\n## 🧩 Compatibility\n - Fully backward compatible with previous:\n    ```ts\n        Maskify.use(app, { fields: ['email', 'phone'] });\n    ```\n - No breaking changes in public API.\n\n## v3.2.0 - 2025-10-16\n### Added\n- ⚙️ **Express Middleware Support**\n  - Added built-in middleware for Express:\n    ```ts\n    app.use(\n        Maskify.middlewares.express({\n            fields: [\n            'email',\n            { name: 'phone', options: { visibleEnd: 2 } }\n            ],\n            maskOptions: { autoDetect: true, maxAsterisks: 4 }\n      })\n    );\n    ```\n  - Automatically masks response fields according to schema or inferred type.\n  - Works with dot-path and wildcard (`*`) notation.\n  \n### Improved\n- 🧠 Auto-inference refined to detect emails, phone numbers, cards, and names using regex heuristics.\n- 🧩 Middleware options now support **per-field configuration** and **global maskOptions** merging.\n\n### Fixed\n- 🧼 Build now clears `dist` before recompilation.\n- 🧯 TypeScript definitions improved for peer dependency safety (Express optional import).\n\n---\n\n## [3.0.0] - 2025-10-15\n### Added\n- Core `Maskify` class for masking strings, objects, arrays, and nested fields.\n- Auto-detection of sensitive types: email, phone, card, generic.\n- Pattern-based masking support (`Maskify.pattern()`).\n- `Maskify.maskSensitiveFields()` for deep object/array masking with schema.\n- TypeScript-friendly with full generics and type inference.\n- Dot-path and wildcard `*` support for nested objects and arrays.\n- Built-in **Express** and **Fastify** middlewares for automatic response masking.\n- Configurable `MaskOptions` including `maskChar`, `visibleStart`, `visibleEnd`, `maxAsterisks`, and `pattern`.\n- Peer-dependency safe: dynamic imports of Express and Fastify to avoid runtime errors.\n- Extendable masking strategies and custom patterns.\n- 🧰 Codebase modularized with `MaskifyCore` and `middlewares` namespaces for better extensibility.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n

Fastify support, decorators, streams, and new masking strategies, your README.md needs to reflect that power.\nHere is a comprehensive rewrite of your README.md. I have structured it to group related features (Basic vs. Advanced vs. Frameworks) so it is easy for developers to scan.\nExample :# Maskify-TS\n\n**Advanced data masking utility for Node.js & TypeScript** — safely mask emails, phones, credit cards, IPs, JWTs, and deeply nested object fields with wildcard support.\n\n[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/maskify-ts.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/maskify-ts)\n[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)\n\nMaskify is a lightweight, zero-dependency (core) utility designed for logging, analytics, and compliance scenarios (e.g., GDPR/PII redaction) where sensitive data must be obscured.\n\n## ⚡️ Features\n\n- ✅ **Deep Masking:** Mask strings, objects, arrays, and nested fields with zero mutation (non-destructive).\n- ✅ **Class Decorators:** Declarative masking using `@Mask` on DTOs and Entities.\n- ✅ **Wildcard Support:** Easy traversal using dot-paths (`users[*].email`) and wildcards (`*`).\n- ✅ **Stream Support:** High-performance masking for large files and logs via Transform Streams.\n- ✅ **Advanced Modes:** Support for **Allowlist** (Mask everything *except* X) and **Blocklist**.\n- ✅ **Deterministic Masking:** Generate consistent hashes for analytics (count unique users without storing PII).\n- ✅ **Framework Ready:** Built-in middleware for **Express** and **Fastify**.\n- ✅ **Specialized Maskers:** Auto-detects Email, Phone, Credit Card, IPv4/IPv6, JWT, and URLs.\n- ✅ **CLI Tool:** Pipe logs directly from the command line.\n\n---\n\n## 📦 Installation\n\n```bash\nnpm install maskify-ts\nNote: If you intend to use Class Decorators, you must install reflect-metadata:\nExample :npm install reflect-metadata\n\n🚀 Quickstart\n1. Basic Usage\nExample :import { Maskify } from 'maskify-ts';\n\n// 📧 Email\nMaskify.mask('john.doe@example.com', { type: 'email' });\n// Output: \"jo****@e****.com\"\n\n// 💳 Credit Card\nMaskify.mask('4111111111111111', { type: 'card' });\n// Output: \"4111 **** **** 1111\"\n\n// 🌐 IP Address\nMaskify.mask('192.168.1.50', { type: 'ip' });\n// Output: \"192.168.1.***\"\n\n// 🔑 JWT (Keeps header, masks payload/sig)\nMaskify.mask('eyJhbGciOi...', { type: 'jwt' });\n// Output: \"eyJhbGciOi....********.********\"2. Class Decorators (TypeScript)\nIdeal for NestJS, TypeORM, or standardized DTOs.\nExample :import { Mask, Maskify } from 'maskify-ts';\n\nclass UserDTO {\n  @Mask({ type: 'email' })\n  email: string;\n\n  @Mask({ type: 'phone', maskChar: '#' })\n  phone: string;\n\n  // No decorator = No masking\n  username: string;\n\n  constructor(email: string, phone: string, username: string) {\n    this.email = email;\n    this.phone = phone;\n    this.username = username;\n  }\n}\n\nconst user = new UserDTO('john@doe.com', '+1234567890', 'johndoe');\nconst masked = Maskify.maskClass(user);\n\nconsole.log(masked);\n// UserDTO { email: 'jo**@d**.com', phone: '+123#######90', username: 'johndoe' }3. Object & Array Masking\nUse wildcard syntax (*) to target fields in arrays or nested objects.\nExample :const users = [\n  {\n    id: 1,\n    profile: { email: 'admin@company.com', phone: '+15550001111' },\n    sessions: [{ token: 'sensitive-jwt-token' }]\n  }\n];\n\nconst masked = Maskify.maskSensitiveFields(users, {\n  '[*].profile.email': { type: 'email' },\n  '[*].sessions[*].token': { type: 'jwt' }\n});\n🛡️ Advanced Strategies\nAllowlist Mode (Strict Security)\nInstead of specifying what to hide, specify what to keep. Everything else is masked.\nExample :const sensitiveData = {\n  id: 123,\n  timestamp: 1600000000,\n  user: { name: 'John', secret: 'xyz' }\n};\n\n// Only 'id' and 'timestamp' will remain visible.\n// Everything else defaults to generic masking.\nconst safe = Maskify.maskSensitiveFields(sensitiveData, {\n  'id': {},\n  'timestamp': {}\n}, { mode: 'allow' });Deterministic Masking (Analytics)\nGenerate consistent masks. Same input + same secret = same output. Useful for counting unique users in logs without revealing identities.\nExample :const email = 'user@gmail.com';\nconst opts = { secret: 'my-app-super-secret' };\n\nconst hash1 = Maskify.deterministic(email, opts);\nconst hash2 = Maskify.deterministic(email, opts);\n\nconsole.log(hash1 === hash2); // true (e.g., \"a3f12b9...\")\n🌊 Streaming (High Performance)\nFor processing large log files (GBs) without memory issues, use MaskifyStream.\nExample :import { createReadStream, createWriteStream } from 'fs';\nimport { MaskifyStream } from 'maskify-ts/stream';\n\nconst read = createReadStream('production.log');\nconst write = createWriteStream('clean.log');\n\nconst maskStream = new MaskifyStream({\n  'user.email': { type: 'email' },\n  'context.ip': { type: 'ip' }\n});\n\nread.pipe(maskStream).pipe(write);\n🌐 Middleware Support\nFastify\nExample :import Fastify from 'fastify';\nimport { Maskify } from 'maskify-ts';\n\nconst app = Fastify();\n\n// Register plugin\nMaskify.use(app, {\n  fields: ['email', 'password'],\n  maskOptions: { maskChar: '*' }\n}, 'fastify');\n\napp.get('/', async () => ({ email: 'test@test.com', password: '123' }));\n// Response: { \"email\": \"te**@t**.com\", \"password\": \"***\" }Express\nExample :import express from 'express';\nimport { Maskify } from 'maskify-ts';\n\nconst app = express();\n\n// Register middleware\napp.use(Maskify.middlewares.express({\n  fields: [\n    'email',\n    { name: 'phone', options: { visibleEnd: 2 } }\n  ]\n}));\n💻 CLI Usage\nMaskify includes a binary for piping logs directly from the terminal.\nExample :# Basic: Mask specific fields\ncat production.log | npx maskify-ts -f \"email,userId\"\n\n# Allowlist: Hide everything EXCEPT timestamp and level\ncat production.log | npx maskify-ts --allow -f \"timestamp,level\"\n\n# Custom Char: Use '#' instead of '*'\necho '{\"pass\":\"12345\"}' | npx maskify-ts -f \"pass\" -c \"#\"\n⚙️ Configuration\nMaskOptions Interface\nExample :interface MaskOptions {\n  type?: 'email' | 'phone' | 'card' | 'ip' | 'jwt' | 'url' | 'generic';\n  visibleStart?: number; // Chars visible at start\n  visibleEnd?: number;   // Chars visible at end\n  maxAsterisks?: number; // Max length of mask string\n  maskChar?: string;     // Default: '*'\n  autoDetect?: boolean;  // Default: true\n  pattern?: string;      // e.g. \"###-**-###\"\n  transform?: (val: string) => string; // Custom function\n}\nContributing\nContributions are welcome!
